# About me
I am a second year PhD student at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) and at [CMAP, Ã‰cole polytechnique](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), Ecole Polytechnique. I am supervised by [Hadrien Hendrikx](https://www.di.ens.fr/hadrien.hendrikx/), from INRIA, and [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) from CMAP.


I am mainly interested in distributed learning, specifically Byzantine robustness and privacy, currently with a focus on the decentralized setting.
