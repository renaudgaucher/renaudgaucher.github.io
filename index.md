I am a second year PhD student at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), École polytechnique and at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en). I am supervised by [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/), from CMAP, and by [Hadrien Hendrikx](https://www.di.ens.fr/hadrien.hendrikx/), from Inria.

I am mainly interested in distributed learning, specifically Byzantine robustness and privacy, currently with a focus on the decentralized setting. You can take a look at my [papers](https://renaudgaucher.github.io/papers/) and my [full CV](https://renaudgaucher.github.io/assets/files/CV_Renaud.pdf). 



##### News

- Very proud to anounce that the work with Aymeric Dieuleveut and Hadrien Hendrikx, [A Unified Breakdown Analysis for Byzantine Robust Gossip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10418), was accepted at [ICML 2025](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025)!
- From May to July 2025, I am visiting [Lydia Zakynthinou](https://lydiazakynthinou.com) at UC Berkeley. Thanks for this great opportunity! I also thank the [FMJH](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/en/) for funding partially this stay abroad.


##### Community

I am currently engaged in the sustainable development group at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), École polytechnique. I also co-founded [Aymeric Dieuleveut's team](https://adieuleveutteam.github.io/) group meeting with [Margaux Zaffran](https://mzaffran.github.io), which I still co-organize with [Daniel Berg Thomsen](https://bergthomsen.com).
