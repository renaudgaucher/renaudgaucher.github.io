# About me

I am a second year PhD student at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), Ã‰cole polytechnique and at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en). I am supervised by [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/), from CMAP, and by [Hadrien Hendrikx](https://www.di.ens.fr/hadrien.hendrikx/), from Inria.

I am mainly interested in distributed learning, specifically Byzantine robustness and privacy, currently with a focus on the decentralized setting.
